## Project purpose

The purpose of this project is to familiarize myself with developing for wasm (efficient execution in the browser -- good for browser video games) as well as for gaining familiarity with the websocketpp library as well as for getting more practice with creating limited-scope real time video games (techniques like frame interpolation, delta compression, etc.).

The ultimate goal is to be able to create an MMO grind game (like runescape, but def not runescape).
